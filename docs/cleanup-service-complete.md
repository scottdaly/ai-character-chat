# Reservation Cleanup Service - Implementation Complete

## 🧹 Overview

The Reservation Cleanup Service provides automated maintenance for the credit reservation system, ensuring expired reservations are processed and credits are refunded to users while cleaning up stale tracking data.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Core Service: `ReservationCleanupService`
**File:** `ai-chat-api/services/reservationCleanupService.js`

#### Key Features
- **Automated cleanup cycles** with configurable intervals
- **Expired reservation processing** with atomic credit refunds
- **Stale tracker management** to prevent memory leaks
- **Comprehensive monitoring** and health checks
- **Graceful startup/shutdown** with proper resource cleanup
- **Error handling and recovery** with detailed logging

### Integration Points

#### Server Integration
```javascript
// Service initialization in server.js
const reservationCleanupService = new ReservationCleanupService(creditService, streamingTokenTracker);

// Start with configurable interval (default: 5 minutes)
const cleanupIntervalMinutes = process.env.CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES || 5;
reservationCleanupService.start(parseInt(cleanupIntervalMinutes));

// Graceful shutdown handling
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  reservationCleanupService.stop();
  // ... other cleanup
});
```

#### Admin API Endpoints
```javascript
// Get cleanup service status and health
GET /api/admin/reservations/cleanup/status

// Force immediate cleanup run
POST /api/admin/reservations/cleanup/force

// Get active reservations (placeholder)
GET /api/admin/reservations/active
```

## 🔄 Cleanup Process

### Automated Cleanup Cycle
```
1. Process expired reservations
   ├── Find active reservations past expiration
   ├── Update status to 'expired'
   ├── Refund credits to user balance
   └── Create audit logs

2. Clean stale tracking data
   ├── Find trackers older than threshold
   ├── Cancel associated reservations
   └── Remove from memory

3. Update metrics and statistics
   ├── Record performance data
   ├── Update health status
   └── Clean old error logs
```

### Database Operations
```sql
-- Find expired reservations
SELECT * FROM CreditReservations 
WHERE status = 'active' 
AND expiresAt < NOW() 
LIMIT 100;

-- Update reservation status
UPDATE CreditReservations 
SET status = 'expired', 
    errorReason = 'Reservation expired - credits refunded',
    settledAt = NOW()
WHERE id = ?;

-- Refund credits to user
UPDATE Users 
SET creditBalance = creditBalance + ?
WHERE id = ?;
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Health Checks

### Health Status Response
```json
{
  "status": "healthy|unhealthy",
  "isRunning": true,
  "lastRun": "2025-12-22T10:15:00Z",
  "totalRuns": 145,
  "recentErrors": 0,
  "totalCreditsRefunded": 234.5678,
  "details": {
    "reservationsProcessed": 1234,
    "trackersCleanedUp": 89,
    "lastRunDuration": 15
  }
}
```

### Statistics Tracking
```json
{
  "totalCleanupRuns": 145,
  "totalReservationsProcessed": 1234,
  "totalCreditsRefunded": 234.5678,
  "totalTrackersCleanedUp": 89,
  "lastRunTime": "2025-12-22T10:15:00Z",
  "lastRunDuration": 15,
  "errors": [
    {
      "type": "reservation_cleanup_error",
      "message": "User not found for reservation uuid",
      "timestamp": "2025-12-22T10:10:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Cleanup interval in minutes (default: 5)
CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5

# Maximum age for stale trackers in minutes (default: 30)
STALE_TRACKER_MAX_AGE=30

# Batch size for processing reservations (default: 100)
CLEANUP_BATCH_SIZE=100
```

### Service Configuration
```javascript
// Start with custom interval
cleanupService.start(10); // 10-minute intervals

// Configure batch sizes and thresholds
await cleanupService.cleanupExpiredReservations(50); // 50 per batch
await cleanupService.cleanupStaleTrackers(20); // 20 minutes max age
```

## 🛡️ Safety Mechanisms

### Atomic Operations
- **SERIALIZABLE transactions** for all database operations
- **Credit refund validation** to prevent double-refunds
- **Rollback on errors** to maintain data consistency
- **Audit logging** for all operations

### Error Handling
```javascript
// Error classification and handling
{
  "reservation_cleanup_error": "Individual reservation processing failed",
  "tracker_cleanup_error": "Tracker cleanup operation failed", 
  "cleanup_cycle_failed": "Entire cleanup cycle failed",
  "scheduled_cleanup_failed": "Automated cleanup run failed"
}
```

### Resource Protection
- **Memory leak prevention** through tracker cleanup
- **Error rate limiting** with maximum error storage
- **Graceful degradation** on service failures
- **Health monitoring** with automatic alerting

2. **Monitor error rates** and investigate recurring issues
3. **Review cleanup statistics** for capacity planning
4. **Verify credit refund accuracy** through audit logs

### Troubleshooting
```javascript
// Common issues and solutions
{
  "service_not_running": "Check server startup logs, restart if needed",
  "high_error_rate": "Check database connectivity and permissions",
  "slow_cleanup": "Consider reducing batch size or increasing interval",
  "memory_usage": "Monitor tracker cleanup frequency and effectiveness"
}
```

### Emergency Procedures
