## **ðŸ”„ How It Works**

### **Message Flow with Credit Integration:**

1. **User sends message** â†’
2. **Pre-flight credit check** (estimates cost) â†’
3. **If insufficient credits** â†’ Show modal with upgrade options
4. **If sufficient credits** â†’ Send message to AI â†’
5. **Receive AI response** â†’ Extract actual token usage â†’
6. **Deduct credits** based on real usage â†’
7. **Update UI** with new balance and message â†’
8. **Refresh statistics** in dashboard

### **Credit Error Handling:**

- **Insufficient Credits**: Shows detailed modal with exact cost breakdown
- **API Errors**: Falls back to regular error handling
- **Network Issues**: Preserves user message and allows retry
- **Recovery**: Automatic balance refresh and retry capability

### **Real-time Updates:**

- Credit balance updates immediately after each message
- Usage statistics refresh automatically
- Dashboard shows live data without manual refresh
- Warning states update based on current balance

## **ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Improvements**

### **Before Phase 2:**

- Credits displayed but never decreased
- No feedback on message costs
- No warning before running out of credits
- No integration with actual AI usage

### **After Phase 2:**

- âœ… Credits decrease in real-time with each message
- âœ… Immediate feedback when credits are insufficient
- âœ… Clear cost breakdown and upgrade options
- âœ… Usage analytics and spending tracking
- âœ… Seamless integration with all AI models

## **ðŸ§ª Testing Scenarios**

### **To Test Credit Deduction:**

1. Note current credit balance
2. Send a message to any character
3. Observe credit balance decrease
4. Check dashboard for updated usage stats

### **To Test Insufficient Credits Modal:**

1. Ensure account has very low credits (< 10)
2. Try to send a message to a character using an expensive model
3. Modal should appear with exact cost breakdown
4. Options to upgrade or cancel should be available

### **To Test Error Recovery:**

1. Send message when credits are insufficient
2. Upgrade account or add credits
3. Retry sending the same message
4. Should work seamlessly with preserved message content

- **Dashboard**: Comprehensive usage analytics and balance display
- **ConversationChat**: Real-time deduction and error handling
- **SubscriptionPlans**: Credit information and upgrade flows
